# meme-vue-app

Vue.js frontend for my Capstone project: Adopt-a-meme.

Many dogs end up at the shelter or rescue, looking for new homes. Older dogs and certain breeds are adopted at low rates, but when shelters include a picture of the dog, the adoption rate is higher. What if shelters included an amazing doge meme too? This app takes in data from the Petfinder API & outputs that data with a generated meme & links back to the rescue so people can adopt the pupper!
